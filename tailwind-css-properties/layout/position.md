<h5> 1. Static </h5>

Position: static is the default value that an element will have. THis is the normal flow.

<h5> 2. Relative </h5>

Think about it this way: you are setting the element to be positioned relative to other elements on the page.

first { 
   position: static; 
} 
.another { 
   position: relative; 
   top: 50px; 
}
