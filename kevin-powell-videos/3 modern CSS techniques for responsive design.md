Supplementary:

<b> margin-inline </b>

The property is part of the CSS Logical Properties and Values Level 1 specification which is currently in Editorâ€™s Draft status. That means the definition and information about it can change between now and official recommendation.
.element {
  margin-inline: 60px auto;
  writing-mode: vertical-rl; /* Determines the inline start direction */
} 
If the writing-mode is set to horizontal-lr, the margin-inline property will act just like setting margin-left and margin-right.
